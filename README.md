# volcano activity 🌋

The earth is in perpetual seismic and volcanic activity ([x](https://twitter.com/search?q=volcano&src=typed_query)). 

It is interesting to maintain the list of active webcams 📹 near the volcanoes 🗻 which can sometimes surprise 🔥.

As many website are not up-to-date 🕸 or ask to pay 💸 for this kind of service, 
we may try to do that via collaborative 🤝👥 open github project 🏗️.

💡 main ideas of this project are 
- (1) 📝 lista minimal amount of volcano live webcams links 
- (2) publish an [API ⚙️](./API.md) + 🌐 Web view of that dictionary 📚 relatively easy to maintain ✍ via github (cf. issues view)
- (3) think of another way to maintain/update/moderate website data 🛢 from users 👨‍👩‍👦‍👦 (if you have some tips about shared data-model solution)
